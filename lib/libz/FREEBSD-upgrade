$FreeBSD: releng/12.0/lib/libz/FREEBSD-upgrade 311275 2017-01-04 09:30:47Z delphij $

Original distribution from http://zlib.net/.  Currently, only trivial
changes were made to support build of libstand and to suppress certain
compiler warnings, we upstream our local changes whenever they would
benefit other consumers.

To Update:
  1) Unpack vendor sources into a clean directory.
  2) Import onto the vendor area.
  3) Merge the vendor tree to contrib/zlib, which contains a stripped down
     version of upstream source, resolve any conflicts.
  4) Double check zconf.h, zlib.pc, and Symbol.map to make sure that we
     have the required changes.  Test universe and commit them.
